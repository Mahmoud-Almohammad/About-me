        <p> Hello every one! My name is Mahmoud-Almohammad, from syria, I'm 19yo, graduate from high school in 2022 and
            now a web developer.
        </p>
        <h2>My education history</h2>

        <p>
            As I said before, I study in jordanian high school in science section and graduate with 96.3 average, after
            that I tried to go and study in a university but unfortunately I didn't accepted in any university, so I
            came to turkey to try to study dentistry but also the same result happen, but I didn't give up! I start
            studying web development and what you are seeing now is a living proof that I'm starting with it and I
            believe that my journey is just started and a way far to end, so I'm so glad to share with you my story.
        </p>
        <h2>My jop experience</h2>   
        <p>
            Because I spent my short-time period that I lived in studying, I couldn't work for a long time and get an
            experience, but i worked for a
            couple of months in several jobs, I worked as a developer for autopilot car's system for about 3 months,
            then I quit, and I worked in a manufacturing sofas and also quit, but the most job I'm proud that I did it
            was teaching kids for 3 years as a volunteer work.
